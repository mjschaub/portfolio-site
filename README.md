# portfolio-site

A portfolio site of every commit I made in my programming studio class. It parses data from subversion, places the information into commits and lets you view each iteration of each project, including the code, size, and lets you comment on a file. The backend parser will upload the commit and file information to a mongodb database started up on the default port and the site will use that database for the portfolio as well as the comment sections.
